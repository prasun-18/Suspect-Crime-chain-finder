# Suspect-Crime-chain-finder
This Linux/Ubuntu-based AI tool uses Nebula Graph DB to find suspect and criminal relationship chains. Raw data in JSON is automated into a graph using Python. Mistral LLM generates embeddings for graph data, and user queries are processed through cosine similarity to deliver the most likely results efficiently.
